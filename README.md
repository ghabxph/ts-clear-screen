# ts-clear-screen

Simple typescript library that clears your console

## Usage

1. Add ts-clear-screen on your project dependencies

```
yarn add ts-clear-screen
```

2. Import on your project

```ts
import clear from "ts-clear-screen";

// Clears your console
clear();
```

## Personal note

This works on my macbook, so I assume that it should work on mac machines. I'll be using this on my linux machine as well, so if this doesn't work, then I will issue a fix. If the code remains the same, then assume that it works on linux terminals as well.

If it doesn't work on your machine, feel free to send a PR and just describe your changes, and we'll gladly merge your PR.
